# Goal:
Tasked with building a functional website using an image. We could choose from a couple images. One being the 'surf and paddle' image which seems to be redundant. The other two are to help with portfolio diversity. The final option was to choose a website of our own liking to replicate.

I went with the final option to have a personalized and unique portfolio. Also, I chose a website I think is aesthetically pleasing while also being challenging to build. I chose to replicate a picture of Yeti's homepage. My teacher, Jess, created the .png file to recreate which is included in my Github profile.

I will be implementing several new CSS properties including matching colors, matching lengths, creating the correct CSS selector combinations, and positioning. Additionally, I will be aligning properties using the float and display properties.

How I feel about this project on assignment:
On a scale of 1-10, 1= Easiest, 5=Average, 10=Impossible; this project is a 7.

How I feel about this project on completion:
On a scale of 1-10, 1= Easiest, 5=Average, 10=Impossible; this project is a 4.

Reflection upon completion:
* This was a very valuable project as many "a-ha" moments occurred throughout. The first 3 days of information clicked and I began to learn. I used MDN doc's to dig deep into understanding my HTML & CSS.

* Problem Solving- I discovered that when I hit a problem that lasted more than 30 minutes without a step forward in resolution, I need to either take a break, do something non-coding related for 5-10 minutes and resume. Also, learning the correct language was essential in order to google solutions.

* I was very proud of my ability to learn and utilize proper alignment using display, float, and position properties.

What I learned in this process:
* HTML Tree
* HTML Semantic tags
* CSS Class names
* CSS stylesheets
  * Normalize
  * Google fonts
  * Font Awesome for icons
* Alignment
  * hover
* Position
* Background images
* Text Decoration
* Hover property
* Lists
* Forms
* Vertical Alignment
* Text Alignment
* Git- routinizing the process of saving my work
* Github repository - same as above.
