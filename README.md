# Goal:
Tasked with building a functional website using an image. We could choose from a couple images. One being the 'surf and paddle' image which seems to be redundant. The other two are to help with portfolio diversity. The final option was to choose a website of our own liking to replicate.

I went with the final option to have a personalized and unique portfolio. Also, I chose a website I think is aesthetically pleasing while also being challenging to build. I chose to replicate a picture of Yeti's homepage. My teacher, Jess, created the .png file to recreate which is included in my Github profile.

I will be implementing several new CSS properties including matching colors, matching lengths, creating the correct CSS selector combinations, and positioning.

On a scale of 1-10, 1= Easiest, 5=Average, 10=Impossible; this project is a 7.
